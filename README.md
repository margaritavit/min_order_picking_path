# Workshop 2023 tutorial

## Outline

In this tutorial, you will solve the order-picking path minimization problem, by detecting communities in a graph.

#### Instructions
1. Download csv files from 'data' folder.
2. Open notebook in colab
3. Load files in colab
4. Run notebook

### Part 1: Generate and visualize network of parts.
  - Nodes of parts network
  - Edges of parts network
  - Visualize parts network

### Part 2: Explore network properties
  - Degree distribution
  - Node strength distribution

### Part 3: Find network connected components
  - Connected components
  - Component Size, Average Clustering Coefficient, Density
  - Visualize connected components

### Part 4: Community detection in the largest connected component of the network
  - Louvain algorithm for community detection (modularity maximization)

### Part 5: Evaluate partition of the largest connected component
  - Measures of network partition quality: Modularity, Coverage, Performance
  - Community size, Average Clustering Coefficient, Density, Intra-community edge strength ratio, Intra-community edge number ratio
    
### Part 6: Graph of communities
  - Similarity between communities
  - Visualize graph of communities
